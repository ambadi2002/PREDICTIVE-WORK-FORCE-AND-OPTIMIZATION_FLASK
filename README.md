## üìä Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
- **Objective**: Prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Tasks**:
  - Data cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
  - Data transformation: Encoding categorical variables for model compatibility.

### Phase 2: Model Development
- **Objective**: Build and evaluate machine learning models.
- **Tasks**:
  - Model selection: Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms.
  - Model training: Trained models using a dataset from Kaggle with over 5,000 entries.
  - Model evaluation: Achieved an accuracy of 90% on validation data.

### Phase 3: Model Optimization and Validation
- **Objective**: Optimize the model and validate its performance.
- **Tasks**:
  - Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning model parameters.
  - Cross-validation: Ensuring model generalizability.
  - Model interpretability: Analyzing feature importance and decision-making processes.
  - Performance validation: Testing the model on the test dataset.

### Phase 4: Deployment and Documentation
- **Objective**: Deploy the model and document the entire process.
- **Tasks**:
  - Testing and validation: Ensuring the deployed model works as expected.
  - Documentation: Creating detailed documentation for the project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Sample Inputs
The application takes the following inputs to predict employee attrition:
- **Age**: 35
- **Distance From Home**: 10
- **Education**: 2
- **Environment Satisfaction**: 3
- **Job Involvement**: 3
- **Job Level**: 2
- **Job Satisfaction**: 4
- **Monthly Income**: 5000
- **Num Companies Worked**: 3
- **Relationship Satisfaction**: 4
- **Total Working Years**: 10
- **Training Times Last Year**: 2
- **Work Life Balance**: 3
- **Years At Company**: 5
- **Years In Current Role**: 4
- **Years Since Last Promotion**: 1
- **Years With Current Manager**: 3
- **Total Years In Roles**: 10
- **Satisfaction Involvement**: 4

## üìä Results
The model categorizes the likelihood of employee attrition based on the provided inputs, assigning them into one of the two categories: **Attrition: Yes** or **Attrition: No**.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis, model development, and implementation.
- **Flask**: For deploying the model as a web application.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## üìú Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting employee attrition. By integrating predictive modeling within a user-friendly web application, organizations can make proactive decisions to retain talent and improve workforce stability.
